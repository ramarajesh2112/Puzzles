Problem:

Given an m by n grid, how many ways are there to get from one corner to the diagonally opposite corner moving horizontally and vertically such that no tile is used more than once?


Solution:
It has a nice mathematical formula and also well documented integer series.
In the code I just used recursion to count all the paths.
